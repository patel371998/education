			   Dear Students,<br>
You are, indeed, blessed to find an opportunity to get education at S.D. (P.G.) College, Muzaffarnagar
one of the best colleges of Uttar Pradesh which has been nurtured and benedicted by S.D. College
Association, Muzaffarnagar. The college has the privilege of having a healthy, harmonious ambience and
rich values which have played pivotal role in shaping the future of innumerable students. Our mission is to
transform students into rational thinkers, competent workers, law abiding citizens and secularly enlightened
individuals. This is my firm belief that the rich values and traditions imbibed here would carry you to greater
heights.
With proud legacy of 68 years, the college has excelled in every field. Many students have registered
their presence in the merit list of CCS University and others have brought laurels in Sports activities in
College as well as University Level. Students educated from the college have carved a niche for themselves
in various fields at national and international levels.
The present era is the era of cut throat competition wherein it becomes of paramount significance that
students be equipped with appropriate knowledge, habits, attitudes and values leading to holistic
development. Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities organised by our college facilitate the process of
creative and critical thinking. They not only inculcate social and moral values, compassion for nature, pride
for Indian culture and tradition and awareness for one's rights and duties but also make students good
human beings and confident leaders. I am sure that you would develop versatile personality during your
study period.
To be successful in life, have ambitions and define your goals very clearly. Discipline and hard work is
the key to success. Be regular in your classes and focus on your goals. Your concerted efforts with the able
guidance of your teachers would definitely provide a you way of being blissful and successful in life.
I, on behalf of S.D.(P.G.) College, Muzaffarnagar welcome all students and wish all the best for
achieving greater success and scaling new heights in the coming session with the efforts and cooperation
extended from time to time by all the Authorities of the University, Dignitaries of the Executive Committee
of the College, Colleagues , Ministerial Staff and Class IV employees followed by the awareness created by
Pressmen.
With best wishes
<br/>
